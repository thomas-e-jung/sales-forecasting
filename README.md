# Sales-Forecasting
Final capstone project for Ryerson Chang School Big Data Certificate

This project looks at historical Walmart sales data with features such as temperature, fuel prices, unemployment rates, and holidays.

Once the data was cleaned and explored, predictive models were developed using three machine learning algorithms: multiple regression, XGBoost, and Facebook Prophet.

XGBoost was found to be the most effective in predicting sales volumes using this dataset.
