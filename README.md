Final capstone project for Ryerson Chang School Big Data Certificate: predicting sales volumes

This project looked at historical Walmart sales data with features such as temperature, fuel prices, unemployment rates, and holidays. The goal was to predict sales volumes for each of the 45 stores as well as 81 departments in each store.

Once the data was cleaned and explored, predictive models were developed using three machine learning algorithms: multiple regression, XGBoost, and Facebook Prophet.

XGBoost was found to be the most effective in predicting sales volumes using this dataset.
